# Bevy Calculator

## Instructions

This is a calculator built using the Bevy game engine. It's simple enough to demonstrate the usage of Bevy with WebAssembly (aka Wasm).

To run it easily in your Web browser, you can use [trunk](https://trunkrs.dev), and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080):

```bash
trunk serve
```

### Alternative

To see the calculator in action, open your Web browser and navigate to [https://jaudiger.github.io/bevy-calculator/](https://jaudiger.github.io/bevy-calculator/). The WASM file is smaller than 10MB, but it can take a couple of seconds to be served by the GitHub Pages.
