# Bevy Calculator

This is a calculator built using the Bevy game engine. It's simple enough to demonstrate the usage of Bevy with WebAssembly (aka Wasm).

To run it easily in your Web browser, you can use [trunk](https://trunkrs.dev), and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080):

```bash
trunk serve
```
